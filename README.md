# National Parks Application

This is a list of national parks in the United States. Details of each park can be viewed on each park's respective page.

If there are reviews from visitors to the park, a green quote icon will appear next to that park's name in the park listing page. View the bottom of the park detail page to read those reviews.

You can access the site here: [National Parks](https://main--harmonious-ganache-76d72f.netlify.app)
